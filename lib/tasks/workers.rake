# Rake task to launch multiple Resque workers in development/production with simple management included

require 'resque/tasks' # Require Resque tasks

namespace :workers do

  # = $ rake workers:start
  #
  # Launch multiple Resque workers with the Rails environment loaded,
  # so they have access to your models, etc.
  #
  # Each worker is being run in their own separate process (_not_ thread).
  #
  # First started group of workers is considered "main group", whose PIDs are
  # saved into pid files in tmp/pids/resque/*.pid. When any worker from this
  # group exits, it kills the master process as well.
  # This is because we want to monitor this group as a whole.
  #
  # Any subsequently started group is considered an "ad hoc" group. Their PIDs
  # are not saved. When any worker from this group exits, the master process
  # and other workers continue running. This is because we don't care about
  # workers in this group.
  #
  # On clean shutdown (SIGINT / Ctrl-C, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM), the task will clean
  # after itself: kill its workers and delete PID files, when appropriate. It
  # will deal fine with already dead workers.
  #
  # Default options like COUNT can and should be over-ridden when invoking, of course:
  #
  #    $ rake workers:start COUNT=10 QUEUE=my_queue
  #
  # To daemonize, simply run with nohup:
  #
  #    $ nohup rake workers:start > log/workers.log 2>&1 &
  #
  # You can set up your monitoring tool to watch for process with PID
  # from `cat tmp/pids/resque/master.pid`.
  #
  # For proper monitoring of _individual_ workers, use provided examples for God or Monit:
  # http://github.com/defunkt/resque/blob/master/examples/.
  #
  # A task for killing all workers on the machine (`rake workers:killall`) is also provided,
  # for pruning orphaned workers etc.
  #
  # NOTE: There are couple of reasons why we needed something like this and didn't
  #       find it provided for in Resque.
  #
  #       First, we wanted to have one single Rake task to launch multiple workers
  #       in production _and_ in development. This was inspired by the bundled
  #       `rake resque:workers` task.
  #
  #       Second, we wanted operations guys to simply guarantee that this Rake task
  #       is running and that's all. We would rather configure and tune everything
  #       (like the number of workers) inside the task, then bother them.
  #
  #       Third, we wanted an easy way how to very easily launch multiple workers
  #       in production (on sudden spikes in jobs, etc), just by SSH-ing
  #       to the box and running the "one and only" task.
